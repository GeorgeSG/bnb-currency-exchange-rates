[![Bulgarian National Bank - Official Currency Exchange Rates](https://github.com/LubomirGeorgiev/bnb-currency-exchange-rates/actions/workflows/update-rates.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/LubomirGeorgiev/bnb-currency-exchange-rates/actions/workflows/update-rates.yml)

All exchange rates in the dataset are based on **Bulgarian Lev/BGN/Български лев** and are set as official rates by the [**Bulgarian National Bank**](https://www.bnb.bg/Statistics/StExternalSector/StExchangeRates/StERForeignCurrencies/index.htm?toLang=_EN).

This repository utilizes the [**schedule**](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows) function of Github Actions in order to update the dataset through a continuously running cronjob.
